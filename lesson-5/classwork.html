      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
      And summer's lease hath all too short a date.

        Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
        When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
